## Tic Tac Toe with the MiniMax algorithm and alpha-beta pruning

# intention

The original purpose of this project was to be an extention of a [javascript project](http://codepen.io/thodges314/pen/VjYWje) which allows users to play human vs computer tic-tac-toe matches.  I had hoped, upon succesfully creating an unbeatable tic-tac-toe game, to extend the game to squares of larger dimensions.  The algorithm, on a 3-by-3 board, will ultimately fall into the familiar pattern that many of us have learned in grade school.  Such a clear pattern is not known to exist for a 4-by-4, a 5-by-5 or a 10-by-t0 board.  Would this become a game that requires the cunning strategy of Go, or would the board quickly become so cluttered as to make winning impossible?
